_**netfcts overview**_

Extensions to crate [Netbricks](https://github.com/rstade/NetBricks). This is a crate containing a common library of helper functions and data structures for crate [TrafficEngine](https://github.com/rstade/TrafficEngine) and crate [ProxyEngine](https://github.com/silverengine-de/ProxyEngine).

_**Installation**_

netfcts depends on branch e2d2-rs-v1 of NetBricks from the fork at https://github.com/rstade/Netbricks. 

Using netfcts and NetBricks requires a local installation as DPDK and some C-libraries for interfacing the Rust code of NetBricks with the DPDK must be installed. For further information see the Netbricks [README](https://github.com/rstade/NetBricks/blob/e2d2-rstade/README.md).
